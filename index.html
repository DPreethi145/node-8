<h3>Why canâ€™t browsers read JSX?</h3>   
<p>Browsers can only read Js Objects Jsx is not a regular js object, to enable a browsers to read jsx,first we need to transform jsx file into
    a js object using jsx transformers like babel tool.

<h3>What do you understand by Virtual DOM? Explain its working</h3>
<pre> Virtual dom is the light weight copy of real dom
    Virtual dom Have two Copies one virtual is present in the mounting phase and another virtual dom contains updated state values.
    This two virtual doms will compare each other this method is called "DIFF ALOGORITHM"
    After this The Updates will be done in Real Dom this method is called "RECOINCILIATION"</pre>
<h3>What is the purpose of render() in React.</h3>
<pre>

    in react 2 types of components are present functional and class.
    in functional componemt the whole component itself responsible for mounting phase 
    but in class render only responsible for mounting
    Differentiate between states and props.
    states and props are used for data flow
    states are smart components because state get updated dynamically
    but props are dumb they are only static
    in state data pass in that component only, but props data flow through parents</pre>

<h3>How can you update the state of a component?</h3>
<p>we can update the state of a cmponent using setState method in class component comming to functional component 
    we use the hook useState() to modify the component.</p>
